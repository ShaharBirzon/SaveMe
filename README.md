# SaveMe
#### By Amit Schwartz, Ayal Meitar and Shahar Birzon
###### This is the final project for post-pc course of HUJI.

**SaveMe** is an android app that was made to help you organize and save all your important stuff.  
In this app, you can create your own categories and add documents. The documents will be safely saved to the cloud.  
Our OCR system will scan your document to find expiration date if exists,
so you can add a reminder to make sure you react on time! (for example, renew your car insurance or passport)
